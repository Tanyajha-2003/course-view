Water pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world today, affecting not only natural ecosystems but also human health and economic development. It occurs when harmful substances, including chemicals, heavy metals, plastics, sewage, oil, and industrial waste, enter rivers, lakes, oceans, and underground water sources, making the water unsafe for consumption and disrupting the delicate balance of aquatic ecosystems. Sources of water pollution can be classified as point sources, such as factories, wastewater treatment plants, and oil spills, and non-point sources, including agricultural runoff, urban stormwater, and atmospheric deposition. When pollutants enter water bodies, they can cause a range of harmful effects, including oxygen depletion, which suffocates aquatic life, bioaccumulation of toxins in fish and other organisms, and the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and dysentery among humans. Plastic pollution, in particular, has become a global crisis, as microplastics are ingested by marine animals and eventually enter the human food chain. Water pollution also has severe socio-economic consequences, affecting agriculture, fisheries, tourism, and access to clean drinking water. To combat this problem, governments, industries, and individuals must work together to adopt stricter regulations, improve sewage and wastewater treatment, reduce the use of harmful chemicals, and promote awareness about the importance of preserving water quality. Protecting our water resources is not only essential for the survival of countless species but also crucial for ensuring sustainable development and a healthy future for humanity.
